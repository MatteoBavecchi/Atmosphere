# Atmosphere
Air Quality Home Device

Atmosphere is the prototype of a device that detects some values of the surrounding air and signals to the user when it seems not to be livable.<br>
All this is possible with the use of gas sensors, temperature sensors, a buzzer and a WiFi module that sends the data collected to two servers.<br>
The goal of the project is its marketing, in fact the Atmosphere ecosystem manages more than one user and catalogs the data sent by the various devices in a single database.<br>
Any aspect has been studied to be as much as possible oriented towards an untrained user, and mobile friendly, that is viewable and configurable correctly from any mobile device.<br>
<br>
The device is mainly composed of a customized electronic board and a plastic case manufactured with the 3D printer.<br>
Everything has been designed, designed, built and assembled by myself.
